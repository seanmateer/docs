### Valid Characters for Event Webhook Authentication 

We have updated the characters that can be included in the credentials for webhook authentication. Starting today, characters will be limited to those that are included on [this list]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/event/#authentication). Please ensure your webhook credentials (username + password) adhere to this updated list to continue uninterrupted access to our webhook.
