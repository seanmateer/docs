## Transactional Template Plain Content

Weâ€™ve added an optional `generate_plain_content` field on Create (POST) and Update (PATCH) calls for Template versions. Setting this field to `true` will automatically generate plain text content, based on the HTML content. If false, any plain text content passed to SendGrid on the request will remain unchanged.
