### Segment-triggered Automations

Automation (available within the Advanced Marketing Campaigns plan) now supports a new entry criteria option to trigger an automation when a contact joins a segment. This also expands the functionality of the exit criteria, automatically removing contacts when they no longer match the entry criteria (i.e., theyâ€™re no longer in the segment). For more information, see the documentation in the [Knowledge Center]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/)
