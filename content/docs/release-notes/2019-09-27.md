### Templates becomes Design Library

The new version of Marketing Campaigns now features a Design Library, a new, top-level navigation item in the navigation on the left that houses all Email Designs for use within Marketing Campaigns. “Templates” remains as an option under the Marketing [New] navigation, and, if clicked, it will bring customers to the Design Library.
