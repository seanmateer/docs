## Invalid Events Retained for 30 Days

In order to optimize the efficiency of our infrastructure, we will cap our retention of all invalid drop events to the last 30 days. [An invalid event](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#different-types-of-suppressions) occurs when you attempt to send email to an address that is formatted in a manner that does not meet internet email format standards or the email does not exist at the recipient's mail server. It is best practice remove invalid email addresses from your database after receiving the [webhook event](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook/) for invalid, pulling from the [invalid API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/invalid-emails-api/retrieve-all-invalid-emails), or downloading a list of invalids from the [SendGrid UI](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/invalid-emails/) every week, and removing them from your mailing lists.
