### Change to Allowed “From” Domains - SMTP

In order to continue to protect your reputation, we no longer process messages with a "from" domain that includes sendgrid.net. Customers should update the “from” address for all of your emails to include a domain you own and control. As a white hat sender, SendGrid promotes and supports ownership of all reputation factors for email sending. One major factor to senders’ reputations is the domains used, and it’s imperative that all senders optimize their own sending to control this reputation factor.
