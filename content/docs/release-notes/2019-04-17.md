### Basic Authentication with Two-Factor Authentication

Previously, customers with two-factor authentication enabled could utilize basic authentication over the SendGrid v2 API, v3 API (excluding v3 mail send), or SMTP. We have identified this as a misalignment between customersâ€™ expectations of security with 2FA and the [authentication options]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/authentication/) permitted on their SendGrid accounts. In an abundance of caution, we have begun rejecting API calls using basic authentication if the user or subuser has two-factor authentication enabled. We recommend [implementing API keys]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/) for your SendGrid API calls. If API key authentication is not possible,  [disable two-factor authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/two-factor-authentication/#disabling-two-factor-authentication/) from accounts which continue to use basic authentication and enable [IP access management]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/ip-access-management/) to improve security.
