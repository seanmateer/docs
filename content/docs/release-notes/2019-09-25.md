### IP Pool Selection

The new version of Marketing Campaigns now supports IP Pool Selection for [users who have created IP Pools]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/ip-pools). This allows senders to choose which IP Pool to send a Single Send or Automation from, providing improved control over reputation and deliverability.
