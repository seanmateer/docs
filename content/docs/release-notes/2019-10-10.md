### Imposing Rate Limits on some SendGrid V2 API Endpoints

 Twilio SendGrid now has a default rate limit of 600 requests/minute/user on some of the V2 API endpoints, excluding the mail/send endpoint. If you exceed that rate limit you will receive a 429 error response with a “too many requests” message. We recommend updating your processes to ensure you do not exceed our default rate limit of 600 requests/min/user. We also recommend building in the consumption of the rate limit headers we send back, which gives specific information about how many requests you have remaining and when the rate limit amount will reset. For more information, see the [Knowledge Center]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/using-the-v2-api/#rate-limits).
