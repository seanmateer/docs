### Send Test for Single Sends and Marketing Templates

The new version of Marketing Campaigns now supports sending a test email to as many as ten email addresses. A test email can be sent for a Single Send, an email within an Automation, or an email design, and allows users to preview email content prior to sending or request review from partners outside of the UI.
