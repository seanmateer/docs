## Essentials and Bronze Price Change

Effective December 1st, 2018 our Essentials and Bronze plan prices have changed. Essentials 40K/Bronze is $14.95 and Essentials 100K is $29.95. This price increase will ensure we continue to provide customers a best-in-class experience as well as support ongoing innovation. 

Please note, this pricing is already in effect for new customers, but existing essentials customersâ€™ January bill will reflect these changes. The features included in the [Essentials](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/) plan and prices of add-ons are not changing. You can review past invoices and update your [Plan and Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) in the SendGrid application. If you have any questions please reach out to our knowledgeable [support team](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us).
