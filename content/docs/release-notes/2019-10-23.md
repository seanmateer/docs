### Domain Authentication for Sign in with Apple

As part of Apple's [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) feature, users may signup for your app or website with a [private email relay](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/communicating_using_the_private_email_relay_service) address generated by Apple. In order to deliver to these private relay addresses, you must verify your sending domain with Apple when implementing Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider.

The SendGrid [domain authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/) page now provides a settings option that will provide a properly configured address for use with your Apple Developer account. For more information please visit SendGrid's [Configuring Sign in with Apple page]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/configuring-sign-in-with-apple/).
