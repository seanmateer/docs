### Support for Google AMP for Email

SendGrid’s v3 mail/send API now supports ordering MIME parts as [recommended by Google for sending AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format) content in Email messages for maximum compatibility with recipients’ mail clients. Senders using SendGrid’s v3 mail/send API can now include the text/x-amp-html content type alongside text/plain and text/html ordered as “text / amp / html” to accommodate rendering across recipient email clients. We do not process the AMP part of the content for click and open tracking at this time. SendGrid’s v2 Mail API does not support definition of the custom MIME x-amp-html part required for AMP content, therefore we recommend customers [migrate to the v3 API ]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/migrating-from-v2-to-v3-mail-send) to send AMP. For more information on Google AMP for Email see Google’s [documentation](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format). For information on how to use AMP content with SendGrid, please see our [Knowledge Center]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/google-amp-for-email/).
