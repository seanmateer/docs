## Plan & Billing Details Page Improvements

Your [Plan & Billing Details page](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/billing) has been updated to add clarity and ease the ability to view and change SendGrid plans and billing details. These improvements simplify self-service plan changes, add-on purchase selection, payment acceptance, and understanding of Marketing Campaigns contact storage charges. As a part of the Account Details for your SendGrid account, the Plan and Billing Details page is only accessible in [Account Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/account) under Settings starting January 7th, 2019. Check out our documentation for more information on the new [Plan & Billing Details page](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/billing).
