### Tracking for Google AMP for Email

SendGrid’s v3 mail/send API now supports click and open tracking for AMP content. Please note that [Google requires](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format) all images to use HTTPS, which will require customers who wish to track opens to do additional setup with their [SSL certificates]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/click-tracking-ssl/) to ensure that their recipients opens are tracked. We recommend sending AMP over SendGrid’s v3 API, v2 mail/send does not support the custom MIME parts required for AMP, and you are responsible for the structure of the email when sending via SMTP. For more information on Google AMP for Email see Google’s [documentation](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format). For information on how to use tracking for AMP content with SendGrid, please see our [Knowledge Center]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/google-amp-for-email/).
