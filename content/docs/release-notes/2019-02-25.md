### Event Webhook Unique ID Specification Change

We have updated the length and format specification of the `sg_event_id`, part of the JSON object included with each webhook post. Now, the `sg_event_id` will be limited to 100 characters, will be URL safe, and no longer has a specified format. You can use the `sg_event_id` to deduplicate events received by the webhook.
