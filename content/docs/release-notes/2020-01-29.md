### Dynamic Templates UI within "Email API" Navigation

Dynamic Templates, formerly Transactional Templates, are used to design, build, test, store, and manage email content sent over the SendGrid Email API. Dynamic Templates can now be found under the Email API section within the SendGrid application navigation. The Templates navigation item has been removed. There are no changes to Dynamic Template functionality.

For more information about setting up Dynamic Templates, visit [How to send an email with Dynamic Transactional Templates]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/) in the docs.
