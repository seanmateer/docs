Expert Insights is a monthly report that will give you deeper visibility into the health and performance of your email program. This report equips you with the data and insights you need to reach the inbox and increase your email ROI.  **See an example of [Expert Insights report.](https://sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Expert-Insights-Sample.pdf)**

Expert Insights is designed to help you:
* Understand your performance trends in an easy-to-understand, shareable format.
* Identify areas of improvement with in-depth data on the factors that impact deliverability.
* Know exactly what to do if you run into an issue with step-by-step instructions from our experts.


## How Expert Insights Works

Expert Insights analyzes your email funnel, providing visibility into how your email is performing as it is sent, delivered, opened, and clicked by your recipients. The report highlights any potential leakage points (for example, blocked emails) and opportunities to improve deliverability and engagement based on our deep expertise in email. This report spans a calendar month. Throughout the report, we compare data period-to-period (30-days to the previous 30-days).

To get the most out of Expert Insights, we recommend that customers have [click- and open-tracking enabled]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/tracking/) and that customers use categories to separate their email data.

For privacy reasons, your first Expert Insights report will cover 37 days of data or as much time as you’ve been a SendGrid customer. If you're a new customer, SendGrid will populate areas of the report that look back past 37 days over time.

[Categories](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/analytics-and-reporting/categories/) help organize your email analytics by enabling you to tag emails you send by topics you define. We recommend using 3-5 categories so we can provide more detailed email analytics in your Expert Insights report.

Reports are generated per [subuser.] (https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/subusers/) Please reach out to our [Sales team] (https://sendgrid.com/contact-us-form/) to purchase reports for multiple subusers.
