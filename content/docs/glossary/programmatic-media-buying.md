## Programmatic Media Buying

Programmatic media buying is an approach to buying paid media through sophisticated software that automates how you buy, place and optimize paid media. It allows you to segment your targeting by demographics or geography. You can also determine the frequency your ads are displayed and where your ads are published without manual intervention.
