## UTM Parameters

UTM parameters are tags that you add to a URL to gain better visibility into your web analytics. When a user interacts with your link, data is sent to Google Analytics so that you can track and monitor your traffic. For example, a UTM parameter can help determine which social media campaign brought the most web traffic or which call to action in an ad generated more purchases.
