A drip campaign is a type of automated [email marketing strategy]({{root_url}}/glossary/email-marketing/) that involves sending a recipient a series of pre-written messages according to a predetermined schedule. This schedule is often
initiated by certain events in the recipientâ€™s lifecycle as a customer, such as registering for
a service or purchasing a product. Drip campaigns are used to generate or increase customer engagement over a
period of time.

Drip campaigns help you to send relevant and well timed emails that your customers are likely interested in
seeing. Striving to send emails that are relevant to your recipients can help to improve your [sender
