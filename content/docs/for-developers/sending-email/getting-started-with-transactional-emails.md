SendGrid is perfect for sending Transactional Emails.

## 	What is Transactional Email?

Transactional Email is a type of email sent to facilitate an agreed-upon transaction between the sender and the recipient. Transactional emails typically contain information a recipient wants or needs and consequently have very high open rates. Common transactional email use cases include, account creation emails, password resets, purchase receipts, account notifications, and social media updates like friend and follower notifications.

These emails typically contain information a user wants or needs. They have the highest open rates across all categories of email.
